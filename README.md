# Romania Weather Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Romanian weather from 2011 to 2021, leveraging Tableau for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reveal how temperature, wind, and humidity impact seasonal changes and visibility.

## Hypotheses Explored
We formulated and tested four main hypotheses to understand the complex interactions within meteorological variables:

### Hypothesis 1: Seasonal Variation in Temperature

### Hypothesis 2: Relationship Between Temperature and Visibility

### Hypothesis 3: Correlation Between Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Cloud Cover

## Tools Used
- **Tableau:** For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.
- **Python:** For data cleaning and preprocessing using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided new insights into the effects of various meteorological factors on Romania's weather patterns. These findings are crucial for future planning and adaptation strategies in various sectors affected by weather.

## How to Run the Project
To view the visualizations:
1. Ensure Tableau is installed on your machine.
2. Open the provided Tableau workbook files.
3. Explore the interactive dashboards.
